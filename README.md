# Diabteller

<h3>About Project</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This Application Predicts wether the user has diabetes or not based on users data</li>
      <li>The result will be shown to user if he or she has filled all the manadatory details in the form</li>
      <li>Based on the Probablity(chance of having diabetes), user will be able to see one of the following result:
        <ol>
          <li>If Probablity is greater than 80% then result is: <i>Alert! You seem to be at a very high risk of getting diabetes.Please seek
            immediate medical attention.</i></li>
          <li>If Probability is greater than 50% and less than 80% then result is: <i>You are at a low risk of getting diabetes.</i></li>
          <li>If Probability is greater than 20% and less than 50% then result is: <i>You currently are at low risk of being diagnosed with diabetes but it
            never hurts to take more care.</i></li>
          <li>If Probability is less than 20% then result is: <i>All's fine! You seem to have very low chances of getting diabetes.</i></li> 
          </ol>
            </li>
  <li>Dataset used is PIMA India Dataset</li>
  <li>Before Training and Testing Data data cleaning is done</li>
  <li>10 Machine Leaning Algorithms are used namely:
    <ol>
      <li>K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN)</li>
      <li>Gausssian Na√Øve Bayes (Gaussian NB)</li>
      <li>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</li>
      <li>Adaboost</li>
      <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
      <li>Perceptron</li>
      <li>Extra Tree Classifier</li>
      <li>Bagging</li>
      <li>Logistic regression</li>
      <li> Gradient Boost Classifier</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>We Always used the highest Accuracy Machine Leaning Algorithm as our Model to test user's data and calculate final Probability</li>
  <li>The user's data has been saved inside csv file so that data points in dataset will increase which can give more accurate results</li>
          </ul>
